        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>Gaming has been part of my life since i was around 6 years old, and so it's really obvious how much i like video games. It's a really fun thing and it also makes me very happy.</p>

        <h2>football</h2>
        <p>Football is a really fun activity and a really helpful exercise as well. I play football a lot in my free time, mostly by myself and sometimes with my brothers.</p>

        <img class="running" src="man-running.png" alt="Running">
        <h2>Running</h2>
        <p>One of my decent skill is running. I sometimes run for execise but most of the time i run when i'm playing around. To be honest, i will rate myself a 3 star out of 5 star in running. I'm actually fast when i run but the problem is that i lose stamina too quickly.</p>
